A STUDY IN SCARLET.

By A. Conan Doyle

[1]



     Original Transcriber’s Note: This etext is prepared directly
     from an 1887 edition, and care has been taken to duplicate the
     original exactly, including typographical and punctuation
     vagaries.

     Additions to the text include adding the underscore character to
     indicate italics, and textual end-notes in square braces.

     Project Gutenberg Editor’s Note: In reproofing and moving old PG
     files such as this to the present PG directory system it is the
     policy to reformat the text to conform to present PG Standards.
     In this case however, in consideration of the note above of the
     original transcriber describing his care to try to duplicate the
     original 1887 edition as to typography and punctuation vagaries,
     no changes have been made in this ascii text file. However, in
     the Latin-1 file and this html file, present standards are
     followed and the several French and Spanish words have been
     given their proper accents.

	 Part II, The Country of the Saints, deals much with the Mormon Church.
